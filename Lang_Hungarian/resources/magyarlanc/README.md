Required files:

* magyarlanc-2.0.1.jar -- custom bugfixed release for us by Janos Zsibrita on 04 Nov 2015
* szeged.dep.model -- the standard depdency model for Magyarlanc 2.0. Downloaded from http://rgai.inf.u-szeged.hu/project/nlp/research/magyarlanc/szeged.dep.model

Since these files are too large for a normal github repository, and because git-lfs only works with the https protocol (and since this repo uses git+ssh),
you can can get these files from a separate repository: https://github.com/dlt-rilmta/magyarlanc_bin.git .
*NOTE:* you first need to install the [git-lfs client](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to be able to clone it.
